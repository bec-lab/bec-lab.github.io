&lt;p&gt;Our part of the project consists in studying the Little Owl through GPS tags to better understand how it uses the landscape. A master student, Clara Tirifahy, also works on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside experts from Living Norway, she gained new skills in open science, data management and standards (e.g. FAIR, CARE), and reproducible workflows. She was introduced to new methods, technologies, and open-source tools to producing more open, reproducible, and transparent research, as a way to improve the efficiency, quality and credibility of science. Now back in Belgium, she is eager to applying these skills in her own research and share them with colleagues.

In 2023, it was organized in ULiège by Nicolas Magain and Annick Wilmotte. 
This year&apos;s meeting was entitled &quot;Small is beautiful, also in Botany&quot;, with a focus on algae, lichens and mosses.

This year, students had the opportunity to discover the life of an organic farmer, to interact with nature preserve managers and biologists involved in LIFE projects, PWDR, natural park or the Wolf plan. The students also visited a fish pass at the Lixhe dam, met a forest ranger/DNF agent and discovered different naturalist associations involved in the protection and preservation of biodiversity in Wallonia.

During almost three weeks, Sébastien, Alain, and Lea went to the Canary Islands to sample 16 plant species across their distribution range for the GuaCaMol project, which is part of Sébastien’s thesis. They visited El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Gran Canaria, and Tenerife, and benefitted from the help of Jairo Patiño, Agustin Naranjo-Cigala, Angel García, and many others in the field work. This campaign ended with a total of 1853 individual samples collected on the 5 islands where laurisilva grows.

jackdaws (Corvus monedula). She works on comparing several traits in three jackdaw populations along an urban-rural gradient in Cornwall,
UK. For urban individuals, she will determine if parents&apos; investments are lower, if stress levels are lower, and compare their cognitive abilities. She will also determine whether there is a difference in genetic diversity in urban populations. She will also be involved in teaching labs and field courses in the department.
