Alongside experts from Living Norway, she gained new skills in open science, data management and standards (e.g. FAIR, CARE), and reproducible workflows. She was introduced to new methods, technologies, and open-source tools to producing more open, reproducible, and transparent research, as a way to improve the efficiency, quality and credibility of science. Now back in Belgium, she is eager to applying these skills in her own research and share them with colleagues. Of course, Lucie also took advantage of her time in Hjerkinn to learn more about reindeer management in Norway with a visit to the Wild Reindeer Centre and breathtaking hikes in the Dovre area reindeer call home!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One week in Norway for Lucie.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/lucieopen.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/images/lucieopen.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Field trip in Taiwan</title><link href="/blog/Taiwan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Field trip in Taiwan" /><published>2023-11-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-11-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/blog/Taiwan</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/Taiwan/">&lt;p&gt;From November 18 to December 2, 2023, Alain and Nicolas participated in a 2-week field trip in Taiwan.

Their local colleagues and PhD students provided a great help to make this field trip a success. During this field trip, we collected mosses and lichens in the gorgeous forests and mountains of Taiwan. Our French colleague Romain Darnajoux was also part of the expedition.
A special focus was set on sampling a giant Cypress tree following an altitudinal gradient, as well as collecting foliicolous lichens, and cyanolichens.

Magain), Dr. Fany Brotcorne (Behavioral biology, ULiège), Dr. Alice Mouton, and Prof. Alex Thornton (University of Exeter, UK). Margaux will work on the impact of the urban environment on 
jackdaws (Corvus monedula). She works on comparing several traits in three jackdaw populations along an urban-rural gradient in Cornwall,
UK. For urban individuals, she will determine if parents&apos; investments are lower, if stress levels are lower, and compare their cognitive abilities. She will also determine whether there is a difference in genetic diversity in urban populations. She will also be involved in teaching labs and field courses in the department.

The altitudinal gradient of the Cévennes offers an ideal framework to test various ecological theories by analyzing the vegetation on limestone and shistous sites. After having recorded the plant species, the students dive into the statistics. This internship allows students to translate their theoretical knowledge in statistics and botany into a biogeography project that students build from A to Z. This internship has been organized for years and is constantly improving thanks to a dynamic team, made up in part of BecLab PhD students. This year for the first time, we used data loggers to record environmental data such as air temperature and humidity. The implementation of this technology has been a success, approved by both the students and the organizing team.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">One week studying biogeography in magnificent landscapes !</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/cevennes.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="/images/cevennes.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">New field course in the new ESEM National Park</title><link href="/blog/Viroin/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New field course in the new ESEM National Park" /><published>2023-05-05T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2023-05-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>/blog/Viroin</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/Viroin/">&lt;p&gt;From May 2 to May 5, 2023, students from the Master in Organisms Biology and Ecology, specializing in Nature Conservation and Biodiversity Management went to Viroinval for our field course in naturalism.
